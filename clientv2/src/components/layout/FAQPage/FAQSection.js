                                1. Use the map or browse the list of shops.
                                <br></br>
                                <br></br>
                                2. Amend the number of bags you wish to be
                                stored and the drop-off date.
                                <br></br>
                                <br></br>
                                3. Start the storage timer once you arrive
                                in the shop for insurance.
                                <br></br>
                                <br></br>
                                4. Stop the Storage Timer when you pick up your
                                bags. This will process payment.

                                In collaboration with First Marine Insurance Ltd.,
                                cover holders for Lloydâ€™s of London, one of the
                                world's largest insurance companies, we are proud
                                to be covering each piece of luggage every time you
                                use our luggage storage service. Our insurance cover
                                up to $3,000 per item of luggage. Make sure you
                                do not pay cash in a Drop&Go luggage storage shop,
                                because insurance will not cover any bookings that are
                                not paid for directly to Drop&Go. You must pay directly
                                to Drop&Go to be covered.
                                <br></br>

                                When you arrange for drop-off and pick-up of your luggage,
                                you will receive an automatic receipt via email. The shop
                                will ask to see a valid receipt before returning any luggage to you.

                                Yes, our location providers receives a commission from all
                                the luggage they store. Because, of course, without
                                our partner shops none of this would be possible.
                                Drop&Go is using the principles of the sharing economy,
